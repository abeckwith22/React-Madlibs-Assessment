# Assessment: React Madlibs

### Part 1: Conceptual
- [x] Answer the following questions inside the ***conceptual.md*** file.

### Part 2: addCommas

- [x] Write a function called `addCommas` which accepts a number and converts it into a string formatted with commas added for readability.

Examples of output we'd like:

| Input | Expected Output | 
| ----- | --------------- |
| 1234  | "1,234"         |
| 1000000 | "1,000,000" |
| 987654320 | "9,876,543,210" |
| 6 | "6" |
| -10 | "-10" |
| -5678 | "-5,678" |
| (bonus) 12345.678 | "12,345.678" |
| (bonus) -3141592.65 | "-3,141,592.65" |

- [x] **Write tests for these cases** and make sure your code passes these. Feel free to add any other tests you deem necessary.

### Part 3: React Madlibs

Make a Madlibs game in React!

- [x] You'll need a form for your Madlib, which, once submitted, shows the story with the form entries inserted.

- [x] You should have a top-level `Madlib` component, but beyond that the component hierarchy is up to you. Diagram out the hierarchy for yourself before you write any code!
    - [x] Please do not use a single React component.

**Document your code appropriately**
